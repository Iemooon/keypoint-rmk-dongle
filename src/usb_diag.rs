//! Transport transition tape plus the wired-presence snapshot.
//!
//! The tape (one nibble per transition, newest in the low bits of a 32-bit
//! word) was the screen's forensic head line; it is no longer rendered but
//! the writer stays as a tripwire for suspend/resume swallowing: a lag spell
//! that begins after idle seconds on the USB leg reads as `s` before the
//! keystroke and `u` only after wakeup. Wireless builds record the BLE leg
//! (`b`/`a`), so the same tape answers both cases.
//!
//! `USB_NOW` is the live input for the panel's wired badge: the tape head
//! tracks the *active* transport (BLE can shadow a plugged USB leg), the
//! snapshot tracks the USB state itself.
//!
//! Cortex-M4 has no 64-bit atomics, hence the tape's 8-slot limit.
